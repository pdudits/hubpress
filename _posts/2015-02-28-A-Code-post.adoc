The main focus on my blog will usually always be code. I like the concept of hubpress, that it gives me quite portable asciidoc environment, but I need to know if there is a way to learn it to highligh code properly.

I will do Java:

[source, java]
----
public static void main(String... args) {
    System.out.println("I need syntax highlighting!");
}
----

or I will do clojure

[source, clojure]
----
(defn main- [& args] (println "I really need syntax highlighting!"))
----

Or I will also do lots of `inline` references.

So let's dive in into the code and see if some highlights can be added.
