https://fabric8.io/[Fabric8] is great way of managing your entire clustered application's lifecycle, configuration, deployment.

The easiest way to get started with openshift is to installl it in minikube, or use its commercial variant, the new generation of Openshift.

These would be too obvious, and doesn't fit the blog title.
I therefore decided to try it on Azure Container Service.
That turned out to be far from obvious.

== Creating Kubernetes cluster

az acs ....

Just four cores in trial - one master and one agent

== Deploying fabric8

Download gofabric8
Start your cluster

== File volumes

Limit of 4 disks per VM.
Therefore FIle service

kind: StorageClass
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
metadata:

provisioner: kubernetes.io/azure-file
parameters:
  skuName: Standard_LRS
  location: westeurope
----

gofabric8 volumes
so it would add hostPath to the claims. These are needed for azure file storage

== Ingress

Expose the ingress service via loadbalancer
Put IP into configMap

== Scheduling on master

kubectl uncordon

== Insecure registry
on both machines edit `/etc/docker/daemon.json`.
