In the first part of hopefully longer series I will focus at the tasks one should do to get plain server -- without the app, but a Java EE full profile one -- up and running in Kubernetes cluster.

== Installing the tools

For this series I will be using my Windows 10 Home notebook. Particulary important consequence of that is, that Hyper-V https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/quick-start/enable-hyper-v#check-requirements[is not availble]. I will therefore use VirtualBox.

=== Step 1: Install VirtualBox
There's not much to be said to this one, just head over to https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads[VirtualBox download page], download and install.

=== Step 2: Install Kubernetes
Kubernetes is a tool for (virtual machine) clusters. However, you can run it all in single virtual machine on your computer! To achieve that you'll need:

* https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube#user-content-quickstart[minikube]: the management tool for the vm.
  Download https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/latest/minikube-windows-amd64.exe[minikube-windows-amd64.exe], put it in a dedicated folder for your kubernetes tools, and rename it to minikube.exe

* https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/#install-kubectl-binary-via-curl[kubectl]: CLI tool for interacting with Kubernetes. They have fancy bash{nbsp}&{nbsp}curl script for downloading the current release, I'm pretty sure it's almost of no use for you, the Windows guy. Here's bit of PowerShell instead:
+
----
$(
  $base = "https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release";
  $ver = iwr "$base/stable.txt" | % { $_.Content.Trim() };
  "$base/$ver"
) | % {
  iwr "$_/bin/windows/amd64/kubectl.exe" -OutFile kubectl.exe
}
----

== Create and run the cluster

We're just few commands away from running the cluster now.

=== Step 3: Prepare Environment vars

On typical home machine, you don't need to set any variables. However, on "enterprise" one you might consider:

----
:: We will download some ISOs now
SET https_proxy=http://proxy.company.local:8080
:: Into directory %MINIKUBE_HOME%\.minikube, defaults to %HOMEPATH%.
:: Also a vm disk image gets created there
:: it also fails if you're not running minikube on your HOMEDRIVE
SET MINIKUBE_HOME=d:\src\kubernetes
----

=== Step 4: Create cluster

----
d:\src\kubernetes>minikube start --vm-driver=virtualbox
Starting local Kubernetes v1.6.0 cluster...
Starting VM...
Downloading Minikube ISO
 89.51 MB / 89.51 MB [==============================================] 100.00% 0s
SSH-ing files into VM...
Setting up certs...
Starting cluster components...
Connecting to cluster...
Setting up kubeconfig...
Kubectl is now configured to use the cluster.
----

You can see virtual machine _minikube_ running in VirtualBox now. Let's check, that it indeed works:

----
d:\src\kubernetes>kubectl cluster-info
Kubernetes master is running at https://192.168.99.100:8443

To further debug and diagnose cluster problems, use 'kubectl cluster-info dump'.

d:\src\kubernetes>minikube dashboard

== Deploy Payara


=== Step 5: Create deployment

Bare deployment of Payara inside cluster can be achieved with

----
> kubectl run payara --image=payara/server-full --port=8080 --replicas 1
deployment "payara" created
----
This starts download of a docker image and creates a https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/[Deployment]
and a https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/replicaset/[Replica Set], that in turn contains single https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-overview/[Pod], that exposes standard HTTP port. It will take a while, since the docker image needs to be downloaded. You can monitor the progress like this:

----
> kubectl get events
LASTSEEN   FIRSTSEEN   COUNT     NAME                      KIND         SUBOBJECT                 TYPE      REASON              SOURCE                  MESSAGE
6m         6m          1         payara-4223602339-vr5w5   Pod                                    Normal    Scheduled           default-scheduler       Successfully assigned payara-4223602339-vr5w5 to minikube
6m         6m          1         payara-4223602339-vr5w5   Pod          spec.containers{payara}   Normal    Pulling             kubelet, minikube       pulling image "payara/server-full"
6m         6m          1         payara-4223602339         ReplicaSet                             Normal    SuccessfulCreate    replicaset-controller   Created pod: payara-4223602339-vr5w5
6m         6m          1         payara                    Deployment                             Normal    ScalingReplicaSet   deployment-controller   Scaled up replica set payara-4223602339 to 1
----
Alternatively you can use `minikube dashboard` for more interactive view.

=== Step 6: Expose HTTP port
After the replica set is running, you yet need to make it accessible from within container inside minikube VM to your host:

----
> kubectl expose deployment payara --port=80 --type=NodePort
service "payara" exposed
> minikube service payara

Six steps are already enough for a nice evening spent at your computer, in next part of the series we'll try to http://imgur.com/gallery/RadSf[draw the rest of the owl]:

* Deploying the app into server, ideally without every build result being 800MB
* Improving logging
* Customizing your domain
* ...

Stay tuned!
