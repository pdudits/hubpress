Jenkins offers nice auto-update functionality, where it will download new version, schedules a restart and updates.
But what to do when it is unable to download the version?

In our company there is this really annoying proxy antivirus scanner, that likes to inspect all `jar` and `war` files for viruses, so things like Wildfly or Netbeans take hours to download. 
That's really bad new when one wants to update Jenkins, as it will time out after minute or two.

The usual approach I take for plugins that fail to download, is that I download them manually (e. g. by replacing `http` with `https` in the mirror link, then the antivirus is bypassed ;)) and upload them into Jenkins. 
This doesn't work for the main `war` file, of course.

Should I've been running on Linux, I would just download the file, and overwrite existing file. 
I'm on Windows and the process have the file locked.
I would really like just to trigger this logic for upgrading the file at startup.

To find out how that works I looked into Jenkins' https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/blob/master/core/src/main/java/hudson/lifecycle/WindowsServiceLifecycle.java[WindowsLifecycleService]:

So I did the same thing manually:

1. Downloaded new `war` file to `d:\temp`
1. Created file jenkins.copies in jenkins' home with content

----
d:/temp/jenkins.war>d:/jenkins/jenkins.war
----
I saved it with UNIX line endings and verified, that there is indeed just single `\n` at the end (service will fail to start if that is not the case).

1. Had jenkins restart once it is idle

1. *DONE*. Jenkins did update just as if it had downloaded the file itself.

I kept the `.copies` file handy for future updates. I will just put new version in `temp` and copy the `.copies` file over.
