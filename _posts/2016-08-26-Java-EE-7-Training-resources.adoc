# Java EE 7 Training resources
:published_at: 2016-08-26
:hp-tags: Java EE

I've done a training with two-day Java EE overview. This is annotated browser history of the things I showed.

At the training we followed book http://www.apress.com/9781430246268[Beginning Java EE 7] from https://antoniogoncalves.org/[Antonio Goncalves].

[[the-code]]
The code
~~~~~~~~

We followed https://github.com/agoncal/agoncal-book-javaee7[code samples
from the book] troughout the training.

[[other-general-resources]]
Other general resources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/index.html[Java EE 7 javadoc] lists
all of the relevant APIs defined by Java EE spec.

Adam Bien’s book http://realworldpatterns.com/[Real World Java EE
Patterns – Rethinking Best Practices] will help you put EJB and CDI in
practice.

https://github.com/javaee-samples/javaee7-samples[Java EE 7 samples]
demonstrates Java EE 7 features in Arquillian-based tests.

http://arquillian.org/[Arquillian] helps testing parts of your Java EE
applications within container - be it just Weld, embedded Payara or
remote standalone servers.

[[cdi]]
CDI
~~~

Read http://docs.jboss.org/weld/reference/latest/en-US/html/[Weld
Reference Documentation] for in-depth details about all CDI features.

https://deltaspike.apache.org/[Apache Deltaspike] is collection of CDI
extensions covering various infrastructure aspects of your application.

[[jpa]]
JPA
~~~

For in-depth look into JPA, design of the entities and trade-offs of the
features, read http://www.apress.com/9781430219569[Pro JPA 2] by Mike
Keith and Merrick Schincariol.

Another great source of JPA knowledge is https://vladmihalcea.com/[Vlad
Mihalcea].

Instead of Criteria API, consider using
http://www.querydsl.com/[QueryDSL].

For managing of database schema I recommend
https://flywaydb.org/[FlyWay].

[[security]]
Security
~~~~~~~~

Ultimate source on JAAS and JASPIC is
http://arjan-tijms.omnifaces.org/[Arjan Tijms] (and also for JSF and
OmniFaces).

[[transactions]]
Transactions
~~~~~~~~~~~~

To understand cases, where distributed transactions are not a good
choice, read
http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/docs/IEEE_Software_Design_2PC.pdf[Your
Coffee Shop Doesn’t +
Use Two-Phase Commit] by Gregor Hohpe.

Also good source for understanding distributed systems, that usually
reach outside scope of Java EE, look at
http://book.mixu.net/distsys/single-page.html[Distributed Systems for
Fun and Profit] by Mikito Takada.

[[messaging]]
Messaging
~~~~~~~~~

Even though Java Serialization is very comfortable, for high performance
systems consider https://github.com/eishay/jvm-serializers/wiki[other
serialization libraries] that might give you smaller payloads, less CPU
usage, and better interface evolution options.

For building business processes based on message passing you may want to
read
https://books.google.sk/books/about/Enterprise_Integration_Patterns.html?id=qqB7nrrna_sC&source=kp_cover&redir_esc=y[Enterprise
Integration Patterns] by Gregor Hohpe (yes, the one of the coffee shop
article).

[[rest]]
REST
~~~~

The origin of the term is in
https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/fielding_dissertation.pdf[Roy
Fieldings’ disertation], where it says it’s not just about HTTP, but
also http://olivergierke.de/2016/04/benefits-of-hypermedia/[about
hypermedia].

Serialization frameworks from above may also be a good option for
message exchange over REST.


[[jsf]]
JSF
~~~

I think no JSF app can survive without
http://www.primefaces.org/[PrimeFaces] and
http://showcase.omnifaces.org/[OmniFaces]. And the
https://www.amazon.com/dp/1908689293[book explaining OmniFaces and
therefore JSF].

[[application-servers]]
Application Servers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* http://www.payara.fish/[Payara] - maintained fork of deceased platform
reference implementation https://glassfish.java.net/[Glassfish]. See
also http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E26576_01/index.htm[Glassfish
Documentation] and
https://payara.gitbooks.io/payara-server/content[Payara Documentation]
* http://wildfly.org/[Wildfly] - open source variant of
http://developers.redhat.com/products/eap/download/[JBoss EAP 7]. See
also
https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/WFLY10/Developer+Guide[Development
guide] for server specifics.
* http://tomee.apache.org/apache-tomee.html[TomEE] Java EE _6_
application server built on top of Tomcat from Tomcat maintainers
* https://developer.ibm.com/wasdev/websphere-liberty/[WebShpere Liberty]
free version of WebShere with heap limit 2GB (total over all instances)

http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaee/overview/compatibility-jsp-136984.html[Full
listing of certified servers]

[[standards-specifications]]
Standards’ specifications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All Java EE specifications are governed by http://jcp.org[Java Comunity
Process] as Java Speficication Requests (JSRs). The list of Java EE 7
JSR with links to spec downloads is available
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaee/tech/index-jsp-142185.html[at
Oracle’s site]

[[misc]]
Misc
~~~~

At heart of every server there is bytecode manipulation library like
http://asm.ow2.org/[ASM]. Other good use cases are writing tests, that
verify correctness of the code (e. g. security check is invoked in every
method).
